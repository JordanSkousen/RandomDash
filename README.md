[Here's my blog post for this project.](https://greenlightstudio.net/2020/02/03/introducing-randomdash-get-random-food-from-doordash/)

Hey! You're lazy, right? You get food delivered on DoorDash rather than getting in your car to get it. But you're probably indecisive too. There are hundreds of restaurants on DoorDash and it's hard to decide what to get. This becomes even more complicated when your wife says she's fine with anything (when she really isn't).

Well, worry no more with RandomDash! RandomDash is a program which will choose a random restaurant for you and also chooses a random dish from their menu. Just log in to DoorDash, click start and watch it do its magic!
